## 07 - Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Gain access to the steam tunnels. Who took the turtle doves? Please tell us their first and last name. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty's dorm room and talk with Minty Candy Cane.*

Walk into Minty's dorm room with the key cutter, spot Krampus and the key hanging from his belt. His avatar image can be [found here](https://2019.kringlecon.com/images/avatars/elves/krampus.png). 

The lock in the closet has the brand name "Schlage" on it, so use the [Schlage key bitting template](https://github.com/deviantollam/decoding) provided by Deviant Ollam from his KringleCon 2019 talk, [Optical Decoding of Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU6FJnbkeLA&t=793s).

Overlay it on top of the image of Krampus' key, and decode it. I used GIMP, putting the bitting template on one layer and the key on another, resizing both until they lined up. The key decodes to (1-2-2-5-2-0). 

Use the [key cutting machine](https://key.elfu.org/?challenge=bitting-cutter) to cut a key with this code, then open the lock in the closet with that key. Walk in, talk to Krampus.

## 10 - Recover Cleartext Document
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*The [Elfscrow Crypto](https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.exe) tool is a vital asset used at Elf University for encrypting SUPER SECRET documents. We can't send you the source, but we do have [debug symbols](https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.pdb) that you can use.*

*Recover the plaintext content for this [encrypted document](https://downloads.elfu.org/ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc). We know that it was encrypted on December 6, 2019, between 7pm and 9pm UTC.*

*What is the middle line on the cover page? (Hint: it's five words)*

*For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the NetWars room and talk with Holly Evergreen.*

Hints from Holly Evergreen:

*... digital rights management can bring a hacking elf down. That ElfScrow one can really be a hassle. It's a good thing Ron Bowes is [giving a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obJdpKDpFBA) on reverse engineering! That guy knows how to rip a thing apart. It's like he breathes opcodes!*

I started with [Ron's template](https://github.com/CounterHack/reversing-crypto-talk-public/blob/master/demoes/demo7%20-%20putting%20it%20all%20together/demo7%20-%20solution%20skeleton.rb) and completed the 'generate_key' function by following the hints he gives in his reversing crypto talk.

I used the LCG::Microsoft rand() code found at https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Ruby

The solve.rb script I used can be found [here](obj10/solve.rb)

I ran this script to generate a list of all the timestamps in the time range given, run the solve.rb script for each time stamp which spits out an attempt at the decrypted PDF. The last step searches through all the "decrypted" files and prints out the name of the files with a "magic number" that matches that of a PDF file.

    #!/bin/bash
    START=1575658800  ## December 6, 2019 7pm UTC
    END=1575666000    ## December 6, 2019 9pm UTC
    INFILE="ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc"

    mkdir out
    for SEED in $(seq $START $END); do
    ruby solve.rb ${SEED} ${INFILE}
    done

    find ./out -type f -exec sh -c '
        case $( file -bi "$1" ) in
            */pdf*) exit 0
        esac
        exit 1' sh {} ';' -print

This returns the a single PDF file name, decrypted using a seed of 1575663650 and a key = b5ad6a321240fbec

Open up 1575663650-dec.pdf and read the 5 word string in the middle of the first page.

## 12 - Filter Out Poisoned Sources of Weather Data
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Use the data supplied in the [Zeek JSON logs](https://downloads.elfu.org/http.log.gz) to identify the IP addresses of attackers poisoning Santa's flight mapping software. [Block the 100 offending sources of information to guide Santa's sleigh](https://srf.elfu.org/) through the attack. Submit the Route ID ("RID") success value that you're given. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Sleigh Shop and talk with Wunorse Openslae.*

Download and extract the zeek json formated log http.log. jq is a great tool for viewing, parsing, and searching json files.

    wget https://downloads.elfu.org/http.log.gz
    gunzip http.log.gz

A hint from the PDF found in objective 10 states that the default username and password for the Sleigh Route Finder (SRF) can be found in the readme of the the ElfU Research Labs git repository. 

If you search the http.log for "README", you find a URI containing "/README.md". Browse to https://srf.elfu.org/README.md and find the default credentials: 

    admin 924158F9522B3744F5FCD4D10FAC4356

Start searching the http.log for evidence of Cross-site scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Shellshock (SS), and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.

I wrote this one-liner bash command which found 62 such attacks and stored each attacker's IP in a file.

    cat http.log | jq -s -j '.[0][] | .["id.orig_h"], ", ", .uri, " ", .host, " ", .user_agent, " ", .username, "\n"' | egrep --color=always -i '\.\.|etc/|<|>|\{ :; \};|\$|\;cat|union|1=1' |  awk -F, '{print $1}' > 62-bad-ips.txt

This command dumps a CSV formatted list of each of those IPs we just found, ready to be pasted straight into the SRF Firewall tool:

    cat 62-bad-ips.txt |  awk -F, '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ','

Output:

    42.103.246.250,56.5.47.137,19.235.69.221,69.221.145.150,42.191.112.181,48.66.193.176,49.161.8.58,84.147.231.129,44.74.106.131,106.93.213.219,2.230.60.70,10.155.246.29,225.191.220.138,75.73.228.192,249.34.9.16,27.88.56.114,238.143.78.114,121.7.186.163,106.132.195.153,129.121.121.48,190.245.228.38,34.129.179.28,135.32.99.116,2.240.116.254,45.239.232.245,102.143.16.184,230.246.50.221,131.186.145.73,253.182.102.55,229.133.163.235,23.49.177.78,223.149.180.133,33.132.98.193,84.185.44.166,254.140.181.172,150.50.77.238,187.178.169.123,116.116.98.205,9.206.212.33,28.169.41.122,68.115.251.76,118.196.230.170,173.37.160.150,81.14.204.154,135.203.243.43,186.28.46.179,13.39.153.254,111.81.145.191,0.216.249.31,31.254.228.4,220.132.33.81,83.0.8.119,150.45.133.97,229.229.189.246,227.110.45.126,61.110.82.125,65.153.114.120,123.127.233.97,95.166.116.45,80.244.147.207,168.66.108.62,200.75.228.240

Next I created a tab separated formatted file of all log entries (CSV breaks because several of the fields contain commas):

    cat http.log | jq -s -j '.[0][] | .ts,"\t",.uid,"\t",.["id.orig_h"],"\t",.["id.orig_p"],"\t",.["id.resp_h"],"\t",.["id.resp_p"],"\t",.method,"\t",.host,"\t",.uri,"\t",.referrer,"\t",.version,"\t",.user_agent,"\t",.origin,"\t",.status_code,"\t",.info_code,"\t",.info_msg,"\t",.username,"\t",.password,"\t",.proxied,"\t",.orig_fuids,"\t",.orig_filenames,"\t",.orig_mime_types,"\t",.resp_fuids,"\t",.resp_filenames,"\t",.resp_mime_types,"\n"' >> all.tsv

To find the rest of the IPs, we have to pivot using information gathered from the logs of 62 attackers. If you look closely at the user-agents used by those attackers, most are using variations of "normal" user-agents, along with some user-agents used by known malware.

These two command create a list of all the user agents the 62 attackers used:

    for ip in $(cat 62-bad-ips.txt); do cat http.log| jq -s -j '.[0][]|.["id.orig_h"],", ",.user_agent, "\n"' | grep $ip; done |tee 62-bad-useragents.txt

    cat 62-bad-useragents.txt | awk -F', ' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq > bad-user-agents.txt

Now let's gather a list of all the unique IPs (in CSV format) from the list of known bad user agents:
    
    while read useragent; do grep "$useragent" all.tsv | awk -F"\t" '{print $3}'; done <bad-user-agents.txt | sort | uniq | tr '\n' ','

Output:

    10.122.158.57,10.155.246.29,102.143.16.184,103.235.93.133,104.179.109.113,106.132.195.153,106.93.213.219,116.116.98.205,118.26.57.38,121.7.186.163,123.127.233.97,126.102.12.53,129.121.121.48,131.186.145.73,135.32.99.116,140.60.154.239,142.128.135.10,148.146.134.52,158.171.84.209,168.66.108.62,185.19.7.133,187.152.203.243,187.178.169.123,190.245.228.38,19.235.69.221,200.75.228.240,203.68.29.5,217.132.156.225,2.230.60.70,223.149.180.133,22.34.153.164,2.240.116.254,225.191.220.138,226.102.56.13,226.240.188.154,229.133.163.235,230.246.50.221,231.179.108.238,23.49.177.78,238.143.78.114,249.237.77.152,249.34.9.16,249.90.116.138,250.22.86.40,252.122.243.212,253.182.102.55,253.65.40.39,27.88.56.114,28.169.41.122,29.0.183.220,31.116.232.143,34.129.179.28,34.155.174.167,37.216.249.50,42.103.246.130,42.103.246.250,42.127.244.30,42.16.149.112,42.191.112.181,44.164.136.41,44.74.106.131,45.239.232.245,48.66.193.176,49.161.8.58,50.154.111.0,53.160.218.44,56.5.47.137,61.110.82.125,65.153.114.120,66.116.147.181,69.221.145.150,75.73.228.192,80.244.147.207,84.147.231.129,87.195.80.126,9.206.212.33,92.213.148.0,95.166.116.45,97.220.93.190
