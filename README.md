# KringleCon2019
Write up for the 2019 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge, KringleCon 2


# Objectives

## 00 - Talk to Santa in the Quad
*Enter the campus quad and talk to Santa.*

**Answer: Obvious! Go have a chat with Santa**


## 01 - Find the Turtle Doves
*Find the missing turtle doves.*

**Answer: Walk into the Student Union, and chat with Michael and Jane, sitting next to the fireplace.**


## 02 - Unredact Threatening Document
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²

*Someone sent a threatening letter to Elf University. What is the first word in ALL CAPS in the subject line of the letter? Please find the letter in the Quad.*

Walk to the top left corner of The Quad, there is a letter sitting on the ground behind a tree. Click it.

The easiest way to reveal the text under the confidential boxes is simply to click anywhere in the open PDF, press Ctrl + A to select all, Ctrl + C to copy, open a text editor, and paste the text. All text, including that under the confidential boxes, gets copied.

**Answer: DEMAND**


## 03 - Windows Log Analysis: Evaluate Attack Outcome
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²

*We're seeing attacks against the Elf U domain! Using [the event log data](https://downloads.elfu.org/Security.evtx.zip), identify the user account that the attacker compromised using a password spray attack. Bushy Evergreen is hanging out in the train station and may be able to help you out.*

Hints from Bushy Evergreen:
*Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts?
I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful.
You can check it out on GitHub.
It was written by that Eric Conrad.*

Running the [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) downloaded from github against the provided Windows Security log file, look for a successful login after a series of "High number of login failures for one account" alerts.

**Answer: supatree**


## 04 - Windows Log Analysis: Determine Attacker Technique
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Using [these normalized Sysmon logs](https://downloads.elfu.org/sysmon-data.json.zip), identify the tool the attacker used to retrieve domain password hashes from the lsass.exe process. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Hermey Hall and talk with SugarPlum Mary.*

Hints from SugarPlum Mary:
*Have you tried the Sysmon and EQL challenge?
If you aren't familiar with Sysmon, Carlos Perez has some great info about it.
Haven't heard of the Event Query Language?
Check out Ross Wolf's talk at CircleCityCon.*

Open sysmon-data.json, find the process where the parent_process_name == lsass.exe, find its pid, search for a process with a ppid equal to the previously found pid

    eql query -f sysmon-data.json 'process where parent_process_name == "lsass.exe" ' | jq

    eql query -f sysmon-data.json 'process where (logon_id == 999 and ppid == 3440)' | jq

**Answer: ntdsutil**


## 05 - Network Log Analysis: Determine Compromised System
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*The attacks don't stop! Can you help identify the IP address of the malware-infected system using these [Zeek logs](https://downloads.elfu.org/elfu-zeeklogs.zip)? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory and talk with Sparkle Redberry.*

Hint from Sparkle Redberry:
*For objective 5, have you taken a look at our Zeek logs?
Something's gone wrong. But I hear someone named Rita can help us.
Can you and she figure out what happened?*

https://www.activecountermeasures.com/free-tools/rita/

In installed RITA and MongoDB in docker containers, used RITA to import unzip logs, generated an html report, viewed beacons, picked the top source IP (which had the highest score and and also the largest number of connections)

**Answer: 192.168.134.130**


## 06 - Splunk
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Access https://splunk.elfu.org/ as elf with password elfsocks. What was the message for Kent that the adversary embedded in this attack? The SOC folks at that link will help you along! For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Laboratory in Hermey Hall and talk with Prof. Banas.*

**Answer: Kent you are so unfair. And we were going to make you the king of the Winter Carnival.**


## 07 - Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Gain access to the steam tunnels. Who took the turtle doves? Please tell us their first and last name. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty's dorm room and talk with Minty Candy Cane.*

Hints from Minty Candycane:
*Have you played with the key grinder in my room? Check it out!
It turns out: if you have a good image of a key, you can physically copy it.
Maybe you'll see someone hopping around with a key here on campus.
Sometimes you can find it in the Network tab of the browser console.
Deviant has a great talk on it at this year's Con.
He even has a collection of key bitting templates for common vendors like Kwikset, Schlage, and Yale.*

Walk into Minty's dorm room with the key cutter, spot Krampus and the key hanging from his belt. His avatar image can be [found here](https://2019.kringlecon.com/images/avatars/elves/krampus.png). 

The lock in the closet has the brand name "Schlage" on it, so use the [Schlage key bitting template](https://github.com/deviantollam/decoding) provided by Deviant Ollam from his KringleCon 2019 talk, [Optical Decoding of Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU6FJnbkeLA&t=793s).

Overlay it on top of the image of Krampus' key, and decode it. I used GIMP, putting the bitting template on one layer and the key on another, resizing both until they lined up. The key decodes to (1-2-2-5-2-0). 

Use the [key cutting machine](https://key.elfu.org/?challenge=bitting-cutter) to cut a key with this code, then open the [lock in the closet](https://thisisit.elfu.org/?challenge=bitting-keyhole) with that key. Walk in, talk to Krampus.

**Answer: Krampus Hollyfeld**


## 08 - Bypassing the Frido Sleigh CAPTEHA
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Help Krampus beat the [Frido Sleigh contest](https://fridosleigh.com/). For hints on achieving this objective, please talk with Alabaster Snowball in the Speaker Unpreparedness Room.*

Hints from Krampus:
*Tell you what â€“ if you can help me beat the [Frido Sleigh](https://fridosleigh.com/) contest (Objective 8), then I'll know I can trust you.
The contest is here on my screen and at fridosleigh.com.
No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want, so I am!
They set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic, cookie needs.
Unfortunately, it's restricted to elves only, and I can't bypass the CAPTEHA.
(That's Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Elves and Humans Apart.)
I've already cataloged [12,000 images](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_images.tar.gz) and decoded the [API interface](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_api.py).
Can you help me bypass the CAPTEHA and submit lots of entries?*

Hints from Alabaster Snowball:
*Have you heard about the Frido Sleigh contest?
There are some serious prizes up for grabs.
The content is strictly for elves. Only elves can pass the CAPTEHA challenge required to enter.
I heard there was a talk at KCII (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmVPLwjm_zs) about using machine learning to defeat challenges like this.
I don't think anything could ever beat an elf though!*

Check out Chris Davis's talk, [Machine Learning Use Cases for Cybersecurity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmVPLwjm_zs), along with his [example code](https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo).

I merged code from capteha_api.py and predict_images_using_trained_model.py as well as some custom code to reformat the uuids.

I ran the training script on my desktop with a CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU, which sped up the training by quite a bit.

I ran my [solve script](obj08/solve.py) from my beefy Xeon powered server, as it was able to correctly predict all the images in under 10 seconds, while my desktop took a bit longer. I found out later on that I could have tweaked the [retrain.py](https://github.com/chrisjd20/img_rec_tf_ml_demo/blob/master/retrain.py) script to use a faster (but less accurate) model, but why optimise code when you can just throw more raw power at it? ðŸ˜‰

The script output looks something like this:

    $ ./solve.py

    challenge_image_types: ['Santa Hats', 'Presents', 'Christmas Trees']
    Processing 100 Images
    Waiting For Threads to Finish...

## 09 - Retrieve Scraps of Paper from Server
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Gain access to the data on the [Student Portal](https://studentportal.elfu.org/) server and retrieve the paper scraps hosted there. What is the name of Santa's cutting-edge sleigh guidance system? For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the dorm and talk with Pepper Minstix.*

Hints from Krampus:
*As for those scraps of paper, I scanned those and put the images on my server.
I then threw the paper away.
Unfortunately, I managed to lock out my account on the server.
Hey! Youâ€™ve got some great skills. Would you please hack into my system and retrieve the scans?
I give you permission to hack into it, solving Objective 9 in your badge.*

Hints from Pepper Minstix:
*Have you had any luck retrieving scraps of paper from the Elf U server?
You might want to look into SQL injection techniques.
OWASP is always a good resource for web attacks.
For blind SQLi, I've heard Sqlmap is a great tool.
In certain circumstances though, you need custom tamper scripts to get things going!*

## 10 - Recover Cleartext Document
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*The [Elfscrow Crypto](https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.exe) tool is a vital asset used at Elf University for encrypting SUPER SECRET documents. We can't send you the source, but we do have [debug symbols](https://downloads.elfu.org/elfscrow.pdb) that you can use.*

*Recover the plaintext content for this [encrypted document](https://downloads.elfu.org/ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc). We know that it was encrypted on December 6, 2019, between 7pm and 9pm UTC.*

*What is the middle line on the cover page? (Hint: it's five words)*

*For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the NetWars room and talk with Holly Evergreen.*

Hints from Holly Evergreen:

*... digital rights management can bring a hacking elf down. That ElfScrow one can really be a hassle. It's a good thing Ron Bowes is [giving a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obJdpKDpFBA) on reverse engineering! That guy knows how to rip a thing apart. It's like he breathes opcodes!*

I started with [Ron's template](https://github.com/CounterHack/reversing-crypto-talk-public/blob/master/demoes/demo7%20-%20putting%20it%20all%20together/demo7%20-%20solution%20skeleton.rb) and completed the 'generate_key' function by following the hints he gives in his reversing crypto talk.

I used the LCG::Microsoft rand() code found at https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Ruby

Looking at the "strings" within the exe, we can gather a few key pieces of information. The first is the error string "CryptImportKey failed for DES-CBC key", which tells us what cipher and mode to use.

Using the exe to encrypt a test file, it spits out the key length, and gives further confirmation of the encryption cipher used.

The solve.rb script I used can be found [here](obj10/solve.rb)

I ran this script to generate a list of all the timestamps in the time range given, run the solve.rb script for each time stamp which spits out an attempt at the decrypted PDF. The last step searches through all the "decrypted" files and prints out the name of the files with a "magic number" that matches that of a PDF file.

    #!/bin/bash
    START=1575658800  ## December 6, 2019 7pm UTC
    END=1575666000    ## December 6, 2019 9pm UTC
    INFILE="ElfUResearchLabsSuperSledOMaticQuickStartGuideV1.2.pdf.enc"

    mkdir out
    for SEED in $(seq $START $END); do
    ruby solve.rb ${SEED} ${INFILE}
    done

    find ./out -type f -exec sh -c '
        case $( file -bi "$1" ) in
            */pdf*) exit 0
        esac
        exit 1' sh {} ';' -print

This returns a single PDF file name, decrypted using a seed of 1575663650 and a key = b5ad6a321240fbec

Open up 1575663650-dec.pdf and read the 5 word string in the middle of the first page.

## 11 - Open the Sleigh Shop Door
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Visit Shinny Upatree in the Student Union and help solve their problem. What is written on the paper you retrieve for Shinny?*

*For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Student Union and talk with Kent Tinseltooth.*

Hints from Shinny Upatree:
*Psst - hey!
I'm Shinny Upatree, and I know what's going on!
Yeah, that's right - guarding the sleigh shop has made me privvy to some serious, high-level intel.
In fact, I know WHO is causing all the trouble.
Cindy? Oh no no, not that who. And stop guessing - you'll never figure it out.
The only way you could would be if you could break into my crate, here.
You see, I've written the villain's name down on a piece of paper and hidden it away securely!*


Crack all the locks on [the door](https://sleighworkshopdoor.elfu.org/) or [the crate](https://crate.elfu.org/)

To open each lock, use Browser Dev Tools (F12 in Chrome)

1: Console tab: scroll down

2: Open print preview of page,  hidden text will show up next to the lock

3: Network tab, watch for a delayed load of a png file

4: Application tab, storage, expand local storage, select the crate url, view the single key value pair

5: Elements tab, expand \<head>, look at the end of \<title>

6: Inspect hologram image, view element style, un-check perspective box

7: Right click and Inspect the instructions text, view .instructions style, look at the first font listed in font-family

8: Right click and Inspect the .eggs text, click event listeners, expand spoil: VERONICA

9: Right click and Inspect the word "next", right click on each span, select "force state, :active", read the new red letters that pop up on the page

10: Right click and inspect the c10 lock element, expand it, right click on the "cover" DIV and click "Hide Element". The lock code "KD29XJ37" is written on the PCB, then Search the DOM for "macaroni" "swab" and "gnome" DIV elements. Drag each into the lock c10 lock div. Click the exposed button.

## 12 - Filter Out Poisoned Sources of Weather Data
Difficulty: ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²

*Use the data supplied in the [Zeek JSON logs](https://downloads.elfu.org/http.log.gz) to identify the IP addresses of attackers poisoning Santa's flight mapping software. [Block the 100 offending sources of information to guide Santa's sleigh](https://srf.elfu.org/) through the attack. Submit the Route ID ("RID") success value that you're given. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit the Sleigh Shop and talk with Wunorse Openslae.*

Download and extract the zeek json formated log http.log. jq is a great tool for viewing, parsing, and searching json files.

    wget https://downloads.elfu.org/http.log.gz
    gunzip http.log.gz

A hint from the PDF found in objective 10 states that the default username and password for the Sleigh Route Finder (SRF) can be found in the readme of the the ElfU Research Labs git repository. 

If you search the http.log for "README", you find a URI containing "/README.md". Browse to https://srf.elfu.org/README.md and find the default credentials: 

    admin 924158F9522B3744F5FCD4D10FAC4356

Start searching the http.log for evidence of Cross-site scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Shellshock (SS), and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.

I wrote this one-liner bash command which found 62 such attacks and stored each attacker's IP in a file.

    cat http.log | jq -s -j '.[0][] | .["id.orig_h"], ", ", .uri, " ", .host, " ", .user_agent, " ", .username, "\n"' | egrep --color=always -i '\.\.|etc/|<|>|\{ :; \};|\$|\;cat|union|1=1' |  awk -F, '{print $1}' > 62-bad-ips.txt

This command dumps a CSV formatted list of each of those IPs we just found, ready to be pasted straight into the SRF Firewall tool:

    cat 62-bad-ips.txt |  awk -F, '{print $1}' | tr '\n' ','

Output:

    42.103.246.250,56.5.47.137,19.235.69.221,69.221.145.150,42.191.112.181,48.66.193.176,49.161.8.58,84.147.231.129,44.74.106.131,106.93.213.219,2.230.60.70,10.155.246.29,225.191.220.138,75.73.228.192,249.34.9.16,27.88.56.114,238.143.78.114,121.7.186.163,106.132.195.153,129.121.121.48,190.245.228.38,34.129.179.28,135.32.99.116,2.240.116.254,45.239.232.245,102.143.16.184,230.246.50.221,131.186.145.73,253.182.102.55,229.133.163.235,23.49.177.78,223.149.180.133,33.132.98.193,84.185.44.166,254.140.181.172,150.50.77.238,187.178.169.123,116.116.98.205,9.206.212.33,28.169.41.122,68.115.251.76,118.196.230.170,173.37.160.150,81.14.204.154,135.203.243.43,186.28.46.179,13.39.153.254,111.81.145.191,0.216.249.31,31.254.228.4,220.132.33.81,83.0.8.119,150.45.133.97,229.229.189.246,227.110.45.126,61.110.82.125,65.153.114.120,123.127.233.97,95.166.116.45,80.244.147.207,168.66.108.62,200.75.228.240

Next I created a tab separated formatted file of all log entries (CSV breaks because several of the fields contain commas):

    cat http.log | jq -s -j '.[0][] | .ts,"\t",.uid,"\t",.["id.orig_h"],"\t",.["id.orig_p"],"\t",.["id.resp_h"],"\t",.["id.resp_p"],"\t",.method,"\t",.host,"\t",.uri,"\t",.referrer,"\t",.version,"\t",.user_agent,"\t",.origin,"\t",.status_code,"\t",.info_code,"\t",.info_msg,"\t",.username,"\t",.password,"\t",.proxied,"\t",.orig_fuids,"\t",.orig_filenames,"\t",.orig_mime_types,"\t",.resp_fuids,"\t",.resp_filenames,"\t",.resp_mime_types,"\n"' >> all.tsv

To find the rest of the IPs, we have to pivot using information gathered from the logs of 62 attackers. If you look closely at the user-agents used by those attackers, most are using variations of "normal" user-agents, along with some user-agents used by known malware.

These two command create a list of all the user agents the 62 attackers used:

    for ip in $(cat 62-bad-ips.txt); do cat http.log| jq -s -j '.[0][]|.["id.orig_h"],", ",.user_agent, "\n"' | grep $ip; done |tee 62-bad-useragents.txt

    cat 62-bad-useragents.txt | awk -F', ' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq > bad-user-agents.txt

Now let's gather a list of all the unique IPs (in CSV format) from the list of known bad user agents:

## Frosty Keypad - Tangle Coalbox

https://keypad.elfu.org/?challenge=keypad

I've got a few clues for you.
One digit is repeated once.
The code is a prime number.
You can probably tell by looking at the keypad which buttons are used.

I found a list of the first 10k prime numbers, and ran this command against it. It spit out a list of only a few options.

    cat prime.list | grep 1 | grep 3 | grep 7 | egrep -v '2|4|5|6|8|9|0'

**Answer: PIN = 7331**

Hint:

    Yep, that's it. Thanks for the assist, gumshoe.
    Hey, if you think you can help with another problem, Prof. Banas could use a hand too.
    Head west to the other side of the quad into Hermey Hall and find him in the Laboratory.

## GrayLog - Pepper Minstix

https://incident.elfu.org/?challenge=graylog

    Normally I'm jollier, but this Graylog has me a bit mystified.
    Have you used Graylog before? It is a log management system based on Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and Scala.
    Some Elf U computers were hacked, and I've been tasked with performing incident response.
    Can you help me fill out the incident response report using our instance of Graylog?
    It's probably helpful if you know a few things about Graylog.
    Event IDs and Sysmon are important too. Have you spent time with those?
    Don't worry - I'm sure you can figure this all out for me!
    Click on the All messages Link to access the Graylog search interface!
    Make sure you are searching in all messages!
    The Elf U Graylog server has an integrated incident response reporting system. Just mouse-over the box in the lower-right corner.

## Wunorse Openslae - Zeek JSON Analysis

https://docker2019.kringlecon.com/?challenge=jq&id=e50513a7-e21b-455c-be36-311a556cb5b4

    Wunorse Openslae here, just looking at some Zeek logs.
    I'm pretty sure one of these connections is a malicious C2 channel...
    Do you think you could take a look?
    I hear a lot of C2 channels have very long connection times.
    Please use jq to find the longest connection in this data set.
    We have to kick out any and all grinchy activity!

## Smart Braces - Kent Tinseltooth

https://docker2019.kringlecon.com/?challenge=iptables&id=aeb965b7-7032-4d84-95ac-ea0c879bf559

    $ cat IOTteethBraces.md 
    # ElfU Research Labs - Smart Braces
    ### A Lightweight Linux Device for Teeth Braces
    ### Imagined and Created by ElfU Student Kent TinselTooth
    This device is embedded into one's teeth braces for easy management and monitoring of dental status. It uses FTP and HTTP for management and monitoring purposes but also has SSH for remote access. Please refer to the management documentation for this purpose.

Proper Firewall configuration:

    The firewall used for this system is `iptables`. The following is an example of how to set a default policy with using `iptables`:
    ```
    sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
    ```
    The following is an example of allowing traffic from a specific IP and to a specific port:
    ```
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -s 172.18.5.4 -j ACCEPT
    ```
    A proper configuration for the Smart Braces should be exactly:
    1. Set the default policies to DROP for the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains.
    2. Create a rule to ACCEPT all connections that are ESTABLISHED,RELATED on the INPUT and the OUTPUT chains.
    3. Create a rule to ACCEPT only remote source IP address 172.19.0.225 to access the local SSH server (on port 22).
    4. Create a rule to ACCEPT any source IP to the local TCP services on ports 21 and 80.
    5. Create a rule to ACCEPT all OUTPUT traffic with a destination TCP port of 80.
    6. Create a rule applied to the INPUT chain to ACCEPT all traffic from the lo interface.
